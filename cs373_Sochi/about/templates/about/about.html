<p class="descript">This website was designed to dynamically generate pages for the participating Athletes, their respective Countries, and the Events that took place during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Hosted on PythonAnywhere and dynamically generated using Django, the website features a responsive design that is optimized for all viewing resolutions. This website was built over a span of 6 weeks by the three dedicated young men of our team as well as one former team member.</p>
